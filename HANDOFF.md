# F407 Engineering Handoff

## Official PS2 module integration - published software closure, 2026-08-06

This section supersedes older PS2 availability and shared-module pin statements
for the current `feat/f407-ps2-validation` working tree. It does not supersede
earlier hardware results tied to their recorded artifacts.

### Approved boundary and provenance

- F407 parent baseline:
  `9f8707280d56ae1c8f8061cb9ec12e75f527d1f8`.
- Freshly fetched official parent:
  `upstream/main@9430817755e6c4dfd5b131959d43c2da1c05cfb8`.
- Selected published PS2 module:
  `pnx_modules/fix/f407-ps2-stack@42a4b35b63ef7b8528ad756e03d17f1c09bab9af`.
  It is based directly on `main@44ff9ab7da4335fb35f9bbed1a1c2a3e4f70d9c5`;
  `f3a3274` remains the original official PS2 mapping provenance.
- Retained F407 Direct BSP:
  `pnx_bsp@da09febe8f5bfe66993010247d4d6731d0ca492b`.
- The official parent was not merged. Its H723 BSP gitlink is `6a716cc`; the
  F407 parent, Board graph, CubeMX output, startup, linker, and BSP ownership
  remain intact.

### Actual changes

- Updated only the `pnx_modules` gitlink among shared dependencies. The
  selected commit retains the official Remoter PS2 mapping, shared `wheel`
  field, and F407 DR16/service stack fixes, then adds the measured F407 PS2
  stack correction without merging the module feature branch into `main`.
- Added the mutually exclusive `f407-ps2-debug` closure using USART1 RX DMA,
  the Direct USART BSP, Msg, Remoter, PS2, and debugger-visible validation
  telemetry. Core, USB CDC, and PWM/A2 source graphs remain isolated.
- Adapted telemetry to the official nested `ps2_state.data.ps2_*` API and
  official `ps2_button` enum. Release edges are retained when a `0xAB`
  controller-disconnected signal clears held buttons.
- Corrected the physical C-board mapping: shell `UART2` is MCU USART1 on
  PA9/PB7 and shell `UART1` is MCU USART6 on PG14/PG9. PS2 uses USART1;
  USART6 is the report port.
- Added config contracts for a valid PS2/USART1 configuration, report/remoter
  UART conflict rejection, and rejection when the bound UART lacks RX DMA.
  The generator now keeps raw IOC transport capability separate from feature
  overrides so invalid PS2/DR16 source selection cannot manufacture hardware.
- Added per-UART generated init guards. The PS2 ELF retains USART1 init only;
  the five existing images retain no USART init symbols.
- Added explicit F407 placement for the shared `.ram_d1_bss`, `.ram_d2_bss`,
  and `.ram_d3_bss` section names.
- Deferred service initialization and both Msg subscriptions from pre-scheduler
  `app_start()` into the validation monitor thread. Increased the monitor,
  PS2 driver, and unified service stacks to 1536 B after retained ThreadX stack
  diagnostics proved each 768-byte stack insufficient.

### Fresh software validation

| Preset | Configure/build/link | Warnings | RAM | Flash |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `f407-debug` | PASS | 0 | 49,792 B | 23,736 B |
| `f407-release` | PASS | 0 | 49,792 B | 15,188 B |
| `f407-usb-cdc-debug` | PASS | 0 | 66,040 B | 67,952 B |
| `f407-usb-cdc-release` | PASS | 0 | 66,000 B | 40,056 B |
| `f407-pwm-a2-debug` | PASS | 0 | 49,864 B | 27,656 B |
| `f407-ps2-debug` | PASS | 0 | 55,456 B | 50,856 B |

- Old-module baseline: Host `36/36 PASS`; PS2 RAM `53,024 B`, Flash
  `48,068 B`.
- TDD RED: the new mapping contract failed against `pnx_modules@8ba925b` on
  missing official API fields. It passed after the one-gitlink update.
- Fresh native Host build and CTest at `pnx_modules@42a4b35`: **37/37 PASS**.
- PS2 config success/conflict/no-RX-DMA contract: PASS.
- Ninja graph counts for `ps2.cpp`, `remoter.cpp`, `msg.cpp`, and
  `bsp_usart.cpp`: `0` in every non-PS2 image and `1` each in PS2.
- ELF symbols: no `MX_USARTx_UART_Init` in the five non-PS2 images; PS2 has
  only `MX_USART1_UART_Init`.
- Current PS2 linker map: `.ram_d1_bss` is 32 B at `0x20005300` in F407 RAM;
  `.ram_d2_bss` and `.ram_d3_bss` are zero-sized at `0x20005320`.
- Current software artifact SHA-256:
  `7950C1561B81C8B037E500EA39629D8FCA89419EE20F2BB114C70E3F0F69E2C0`.
- Relative to the old PS2 WIP image, the current software artifact adds
  `2,432 B` RAM and `2,788 B` Flash. This includes the measured 1536-byte
  monitor, PS2, and service stack corrections plus the latest shared state.

### Attended hardware validation - precursor artifact

The attended result below applies to the earlier `f3a3274`-based image with
the same three 1536-byte runtime stacks. The published `42a4b35` artifact was
software-validated but was not reflashed in this publication task.

- Target board: CMSIS-DAP serial `482752183208`; the other attached DAP
  `482752132243` was not touched.
- Final ELF SHA-256:
  `F7BE6A16A009118715E53A936762D8F9E6E386604D7A98BA182C2B5B92F436A0`.
  OpenOCD program and verify passed.
- Receiver on physical C-board `UART2` reached USART1/PB7 through DMA2 Stream2
  at 9600 8N1 with UART `ErrorCode=0`.
- Before pairing, repeated `0xAB` bytes correctly produced `link=1`. After
  pairing, `passed=true`, `stage_mask=0x1ff`, `failure_mask=0`, `link=0`,
  `generic_source=3`, and `mapping_match=true`.
- Connected frames reached 14,478 in the final snapshot. Cross produced
  `buttons=0x4000` and `cross=true`; the left-stick extreme produced raw Y 0
  and normalized `left_y=1.0`.
- Final ThreadX high-water margins were PS2 driver 628 B, unified service
  532 B, and validation monitor 508 B. The PC remained in the ThreadX
  scheduler and `_tx_thread_system_state` was zero.
- Motor output remained zero throughout the attended test.

### Remaining boundary

Receiver unplug/offline recovery, exhaustive all-button/four-axis coverage,
and a separate long-duration soak were not run. This validation closure is
not a DR16-to-PS2 automatic fallback claim.

## Direct BSP source ownership correction — local parent closure, 2026-08-03

This section supersedes every older statement below about the current location
of F407 Direct BSP implementation source. Historical build and hardware records
remain scoped to their recorded commits and artifacts.

### Approved boundary

The user clarified that removing the backend forwarding layer never meant
removing `src` from the BSP repository. The accepted path is now:

```text
Application / Device / Module
             -> pnx_bsp/*/include public API
             -> pnx_bsp/*/src direct F407 implementation
             -> parent CubeMX handles / STM32F4 HAL / CMSIS
```

No `detail::backend_*`, runtime registry, factory, or platform selector was
restored. Parent Board files still own IOC/generated code, startup, linker and
middleware integration; the F407 `pnx_bsp` branch owns the direct peripheral
implementation.

### Baseline and branch assessment

- Parent baseline:
  `arch-cleanup-rc1@731d1b43742857a47ce3e16d71172c110c5e6cbc`.
- BSP baseline:
  `arch-cleanup-rc1@f7b9c541f977b157dd349f9d8ffd37ea6b252be7`.
- Published BSP result:
  `F4_version_bsp@da09febe8f5bfe66993010247d4d6731d0ca492b`.
- Local parent functional result:
  `arch-cleanup-rc1@5f222b68530b135fb46bc3c12de8127ef5fff6f0`.
- The parent branch started as a strict four-commit descendant of
  `upstream/F4_version@ed9a227`; the functional result adds the Direct BSP
  source-ownership commit without changing Device/Lib/Module pins.
- The BSP commit is advertised by the official remote and is safe to pin.
  Parent push, fresh recursive clone and tag creation have not run. Two earlier
  cleanup commits retain range-level CRLF whitespace findings; this task does
  not rewrite that existing history.

### Actual changes

- Moved 15 implementation files without content changes:
  - CAN -> `pnx_bsp/can/src`;
  - diagnostics and strong fault handlers -> `pnx_bsp/diagnostics/src`;
  - Flash, indicator, PWM, SPI, USART and USB -> their respective
    `pnx_bsp/*/src` directories;
  - private channel/device/transport helpers moved beside their owning source.
- Every new file has the same Git blob ID as its former
  `boards/dji_c_board_f407/bsp` path.
- Root CMake now selects `pnx_bsp/*/src/bsp_*.cpp`. PWM and USB private include
  directories are added only to their own closures.
- Added `direct_bsp_source_layout`: it first failed because
  `pnx_bsp/can/src/bsp_can.cpp` was absent, then passed after relocation. It
  also rejects a second parent Board implementation and retired backend
  forwarding symbols.
- Updated the root, Board and BSP ownership documentation. Historical audit
  files were not rewritten.

### Fresh software validation

| Preset | Configure/build/link | Warnings | RAM | Flash |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `f407-debug` | PASS | 0 | 49,792 B | 23,736 B |
| `f407-release` | PASS | 0 | 49,792 B | 15,188 B |
| `f407-usb-cdc-debug` | PASS | 0 | 66,040 B | 67,952 B |
| `f407-usb-cdc-release` | PASS | 0 | 66,000 B | 40,056 B |
| `f407-pwm-a2-debug` | PASS | 0 | 49,864 B | 27,656 B |

- Host configure/build: PASS with zero warnings; CTest **36/36 PASS**.
- Dormant CAN, USART, SPI, Flash and EXTI sources pass GNU Arm
  `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fsyntax-only` from their new locations.
- Source graphs contain only diagnostics/DWT/indicator for Core, add only USB
  for USB images, and add only PWM for the PWM image. No graph compiles a
  parent `boards/.../bsp` implementation.
- Every ELF has exactly one `app_start` and zero duplicate strong `bsp::*`
  symbols. CAN/USART generated init authority remains false in all five images.
- Ten public BSP headers have zero STM32 HAL type/handle leakage.
- Source scans find zero `detail::backend_*` or `pnx_backends` implementation.
- All three retired validation selectors still fail closed.
- The BSP worktree is clean at the published SHA. The parent functional commit
  and current documentation diff pass `git diff --check`; the local `.codex`
  task packet is deliberately untracked. Two pre-existing, unrelated July audit
  reports were preserved unchanged and are not part of this Gate.

## Latest pnx_template main alignment — local working tree, 2026-07-30

This section supersedes the shared-pin and current-working-tree statements
below. It records a local-only alignment with
`pnx_template/main@cf6577765358822a1bc57c1ea17fe65a795ceb62`.
No commit, push, tag, remote change, CubeMX regeneration, or hardware
operation was performed.

### Compared remote state

- Official `pnx_template/main` is
  `cf6577765358822a1bc57c1ea17fe65a795ceb62`.
- Official `pnx_template/F4_version` remains
  `aafa57c7f0b7f20276efa14fd74cbc060cc2902b`. It is a merge of the prior
  F407 work and `cf65777`, but deliberately retained the older shared
  Device/Lib/Module gitlinks.
- The Feishu workflow blob is already identical on official `main` and
  `F4_version`. No local workflow change is required.
- H7 USART10 Board/IOC changes, H7 demo composition, temporary IMU
  live-watch diagnostics, `.clangd`, and `.settings` files were not ported
  into the F407 architecture.

### Local modifications for review

- Parent base:
  `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture@d9d85acdca5a82a330762e02c7dd9b0f580d54bb`.
- Updated exact shared pins:
  - `pnx_devices@2349cc108c9ed477ccdcd700e802ea888975cdfd`
  - `pnx_libs@e7c3e7a2b9d825586ab3e0c413877180c4295df8`
  - `pnx_modules@8ba925b60b11fec511a57622c199b57bb23f8f4e`
- `pnx_bsp` remains on the Direct BSP lineage at
  `4d3ce2abb3dee18ad551cb03428563b38e384050` with an uncommitted,
  board-neutral USART line-configuration declaration. The F407 Board source
  directly implements it; no `detail::backend_*` or runtime registry was
  added.
- The F407 config generator now emits disabled-by-default PS2 feature,
  binding, and timing symbols plus LK8016/LK9025 model identifiers. It does
  not add PS2, AHRS, BMI088, or motor source to an RC2 image.
- Host contracts cover the new USART API, generated PS2/LK config, and the
  latest BMI088/LK9025/PID/PS2 public API surface.

### Fresh local evidence

- Host configure/build and CTest: **35/35 PASS**.
- All five F407 presets configure, compile, and link with zero warnings.
  RAM/Flash usage is unchanged from the prior RC2 table.
- Every ELF contains exactly one `app_start` and no duplicate strong
  `bsp::*` definition.
- Core, USB, and PWM command graphs remain isolated. No graph includes CAN,
  USART, SPI, Flash, Device, Module, PS2, BMI088, or retired validation
  source; USB and PWM add only their respective closures.
- All three retired selectors still fail fast.
- GNU Arm `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fsyntax-only` passes for the modified
  F407 `bsp_usart.cpp` and the latest PS2, merged Remoter, DR16, VT03, and
  Referee consumers.
- Public shared headers contain no STM32 HAL type or handle leakage.

### Deferred findings retained

- The latest BMI088 source still requires a Board-owned
  `GYRO_INT_Pin`/EXTI mapping. A focused F407 syntax check stops at that
  unresolved symbol, so BMI088/AHRS remains
  `NOT_IN_RC2_PRODUCT_GRAPH`.
- The latest AHRS service directly contains the Tactical EKF and an enlarged
  8192-byte IMU thread stack. Because AHRS is outside RC2, no runtime,
  memory-budget, or hardware claim is made for it.
- Shared Remoter sources still use the legacy `RAM_D1_BSS` portability macro.
  This branch adds explicit F407 linker output sections for `.ram_d1_bss`,
  `.ram_d2_bss`, and `.ram_d3_bss` so PS2/msg/remoter buffers are no longer
  orphan sections when linked into an F407 image.
- Shared `remoter::service` can arbitrate among DR16 / VT03 / PS2, but the
  generated config still emits mutually exclusive source enables. This branch
  only validates the single-source PS2 path; DR16↔PS2 automatic fallback
  remains a shared follow-up design task rather than a claimed fix.

## RC2 release-closure result — 2026-07-30

This section is the current authority for
`F407-DIRECT-BSP-RC2-RELEASE-CLOSURE`. The user corrected two acceptance
definitions after the first closure report: H7 is out of scope, and generated
Board source presence alone is not Direct-BSP closure leakage. Parent
publication and tagging remain pending, but the user-authorized compile-time
guards now satisfy the corrected F407 Core call-graph Gate. No hardware was
operated in this closure.

### Git and architecture state

- Initial parent:
  `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture@a9d63a3c7c733529fe02df181b8dfcaeb09d0e00`.
- The Direct BSP architecture/build/test change is committed locally as
  `2e4b80d211bb660d08bf48f3484d2922a80fff85`. Parent push,
  official-branch integration, fresh remote clone, and the RC2 tag are still
  pending at this snapshot.
- `pnx_bsp` has one local atomic candidate commit:
  `4d3ce2abb3dee18ad551cb03428563b38e384050`
  (`refactor: finalize board-selected direct BSP contracts`). Its worktree is
  clean. It is remotely reachable through official
  `pnx_bsp/F4_version@c83e892d9ba76e2671e8d1c8fbc2939a7a77e9df`;
  that non-force merge tip differs from the tested candidate only by retaining
  the official Feishu workflow. The previous H7-based stop condition is void.
- Template-shared pins remain source-clean and exact:
  - `pnx_devices@8a6783e63d77a15940aea8245bbe2eb13a2f2b11`
  - `pnx_libs@55bd94060b7be562ce7a6773822a6a4d2bcab9c0`
  - `pnx_modules@a54c493020ba9bcd5b43b99e068a06cdda9dd018`
- Public BSP headers have zero forbidden STM32 HAL/MCU-handle matches.
- F407 sources and host fakes directly define public `bsp::*`; no
  `detail::backend_*` or `pnx_backends` implementation is restored.
- The official targets exist at
  `pnx_template/F4_version@cf6577765358822a1bc57c1ea17fe65a795ceb62`
  and `pnx_bsp/F4_version@c83e892d9ba76e2671e8d1c8fbc2939a7a77e9df`.
  The local parent has no common ancestor with the official parent branch;
  the BSP branches share a base but have diverged. A force push is prohibited,
  so official integration remains a separate reviewed non-force step.

### USB contract closure

- `init(ok)` means raw config/callback ownership accepted, required ThreadX
  resources created, and asynchronous startup worker scheduled. It does not
  mean enumerated, host-connected, or CDC-ready.
- `connected()` is true only while the controller and CDC transport are
  usable. Controller/activation/resource failure enters observable
  `link_state::fault`.
- `write()` is bounded and copies caller data. Before ready, after disconnect,
  or when the bounded queue cannot accept data it returns a non-`ok` status.
- Same-config re-init is idempotent. Incompatible callback, user context, or
  config is rejected without replacing ownership.
- `fill_tx` runs in the BSP worker, `on_rx` in the USBX bulk-OUT thread, and
  `on_tx_done` in the USBX bulk-IN thread. Buffers live only for the callback;
  callbacks must not block. Disconnect retires queued/in-flight ownership and
  suppresses late success.
- Fresh native configure/build and CTest:
  **33/33 PASS**, including resource failure, async success, controller
  failure, ready transition, write-before-ready, pending-TX disconnect,
  re-init/ownership, identity fail-closed, and 64-byte/ZLP regressions.

The CubeMX PCD initialization still runs before the BSP lifecycle exists.
Its failure follows the existing diagnostic fail-stop `Error_Handler()` path;
it is observable fail-stop, not a BSP runtime-state transition.

### Final local F407 software evidence

All builds used fresh ASCII temporary build directories and GNU Arm
13.3.1. Configure, compile, and link passed with zero compiler/linker warnings:

| Preset | RAM | Flash | `app_start` | duplicate strong `bsp::*` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `f407-debug` | 49,792 B | 23,736 B | 1 | 0 |
| `f407-release` | 49,792 B | 15,188 B | 1 | 0 |
| `f407-usb-cdc-debug` | 66,040 B | 67,952 B | 1 | 0 |
| `f407-usb-cdc-release` | 66,000 B | 40,056 B | 1 | 0 |
| `f407-pwm-a2-debug` | 49,864 B | 27,656 B | 1 | 0 |

The three retired selectors for CAN/M2006, BMI088, and DBUS RX each failed
configure with exit code 1 and the intended retirement message.

Direct-BSP source selection is isolated: Core links no
`bsp_can.cpp`/`bsp_usart.cpp`/`bsp_spi.cpp`/`bsp_flash.cpp`, USB adds only its
USB closure, and PWM adds only its PWM closure. Generated Board source
presence is not leakage by itself. CMake now derives CAN/USART capability
macros from membership of the corresponding Direct BSP source in
`PNX_EMBEDDED_SOURCES`; there is no second cache option or runtime selector.
`main.c` guards the CAN1/CAN2 and USART1/3/6 headers and init calls with those
derived values. All five RC2 images compile both values as `0`; fresh ELFs
contain zero matching calls, zero retained `MX_*_Init` symbols, and zero
`HAL_CAN_Init`/`HAL_UART_Init` symbols. Generated `can.c` and `usart.c` still
compile as dormant Board capability source. Direct `bsp::can::init()` and
`bsp::usart::init()` do not call `MX_*_Init` or HAL peripheral init again.

H7 is a separate BSP implementation and release path. No H7 result is an RC2
finding or Gate:

```text
H7_REGRESSION=OUT_OF_SCOPE

Historical hardware observations below remain evidence for their exact older
artifacts and scopes. They are not RC2 hardware revalidation.

## Pre-RC2 direct BSP working-tree record — 2026-07-30

This older section is retained as historical engineering evidence. Its
build counts and current-support statements are superseded by the RC2
release-closure result above.

### Scope and Git state

- Repository: `pnx_f4_minimal`
- Parent branch: `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture`
- Parent baseline: `a9d63a3c7c733529fe02df181b8dfcaeb09d0e00`
- Pre-existing dirty path at task intake: `AGENTS.md`
- No commit, push, tag, remote change or Vault write was performed by this
  task. User-authorized Core, servo, CAN/M2006, BMI088 and DBUS hardware
  checks were performed; their exact boundaries are recorded below.
- `pnx_bsp` remains the only shared submodule with F407 architecture changes;
  its current checkout starts at
  `d827ca06cde685cccae5274a3e5c689fb7d9a6ba` and has uncommitted changes.
- The other three submodules now exactly match `pnx_template`:
  - `pnx_devices@8a6783e63d77a15940aea8245bbe2eb13a2f2b11`
  - `pnx_libs@55bd94060b7be562ce7a6773822a6a4d2bcab9c0`
  - `pnx_modules@a54c493020ba9bcd5b43b99e068a06cdda9dd018`

### Architecture result

- Public MCU-neutral contracts remain under `pnx_bsp/*/include`.
- F407 sources under `boards/dji_c_board_f407/bsp/` directly define public
  `bsp::*` symbols for CAN, diagnostics, Flash, indicator, PWM, SPI, USART and
  USB.
- The former `public -> detail::backend_* -> board backend -> HAL` forwarding
  path and `boards/dji_c_board_f407/pnx_backends` sources were removed.
- Host fakes now directly define the same public symbols. They verify API
  contracts, not F407 HAL runtime.
- Device and Module code may depend on public BSP headers; HAL handles, pins,
  DMA and IRQ details remain board-private.
- No H7 source or validation was added or claimed.

### Reproducibility cleanup

BMI088, DBUS RX and CAN/M2006 validation presets/options, demos, CI builds and
dependent host tests were removed when Device/Lib/Module returned to template
gitlinks. CMake rejects their retired selectors rather than silently producing
an incomplete image.

CAN, SPI, USART and Flash direct BSP sources remain available for future
application repositories, but no active application closure in this
repository selects them. Historical BMI088, DBUS and CAN hardware observations
later in this file remain historical only.

### Fresh local software evidence

Observed on 2026-07-30:

- Native host configure/build and CTest:
  `cmake -S . -B build/final-20260730-host -G Ninja -DPNX_HOST_TESTS=ON`,
  `cmake --build build/final-20260730-host`,
  `ctest --test-dir build/final-20260730-host --output-on-failure`:
  **23/23 PASS**.
  The suite includes direct tests of the board-private USB session/generation
  policy, USART RX publish-before-start rollback, the actual template
  `motor.hpp` default CAN configuration, and SPI/PWM compatibility entry
  points.
- Embedded presets configured and built successfully:
  - `f407-debug`: RAM 49,792 B; Flash 28,308 B.
  - `f407-release`: RAM 49,792 B; Flash 17,468 B.
  - `f407-usb-cdc-debug`: RAM 66,040 B; Flash 70,468 B.
  - `f407-usb-cdc-release`: RAM 66,000 B; Flash 41,908 B.
  - `f407-pwm-a2-debug`: RAM 49,864 B; Flash 32,188 B.
- Focused F407 ARM `-fsyntax-only` checks passed for the dormant direct
  `bsp_can.cpp`, `bsp_spi.cpp`, `bsp_flash.cpp` and `bsp_usart.cpp`.
- Focused ARM syntax checks also passed for the actual template consumers
  `pnx_devices/motors/motor/src/motorhandler.cpp` and
  `pnx_modules/remoter/src/dr16.cpp`.
- Actual Ninja command graphs:
  - Core selected only diagnostics, indicator and fault-handler direct BSP
    sources.
  - USB additionally selected `bsp_usb.cpp`.
  - PWM additionally selected `bsp_pwm.cpp`.
  - No graph contained `pnx_backends`, BMI088, DBUS RX or CAN/M2006
    validation sources.
- Public-header scan found no STM32 HAL type or peripheral handle in the
  retained CAN/SPI/USART/Flash/USB/PWM/indicator public headers.
- Template compatibility names stay HAL-free: `fdcan1/fdcan2` alias the F407
  CAN slots, while unsupported template PWM timer names fail closed.
- Independent static re-review found no remaining Critical or Important issue
  after USB lifecycle serialization/generation checks and USART RX ordering
  were corrected.

### Fresh Core hardware evidence

Observed on the connected DJI C-board on 2026-07-30:

- A clean-first 199-step `f407-debug` build produced
  `build/f407-debug/pnx_embedded.elf`, SHA-256
  `EDB72454568B5C719C622B5492BDCDF0B9AB61D1792343FD04D630E7A64A78CA`.
- Horco CMSIS-DAP v2 serial `482752132243` identified a Cortex-M4 r0p1 target,
  SWD DPIDR `0x2ba01477`, STM32 device ID `0x10076413`, and 1024 KiB Flash.
- OpenOCD program and read-back verification completed with `Verified OK`.
- Two reset/run attempts both reached the fresh ELF's `app_start` at
  `0x08006266`.
- After resume, PC samples were in the ThreadX PendSV handler.
  `DWT_CTRL=0x40000001` and `DWT_CYCCNT` advanced from `0x08331bdf` through
  `0x0e3fd50a` to `0x144ede84`.
- `GPIOH_ODR` changed from `0x00000000` to `0x00000800`, proving electrical
  activity on the Core smoke image's PH11 green-indicator output.
- The final command returned the verified Core image to reset/run and shut
  OpenOCD down.

This is a short, debugger-observed Core check. Physical LED appearance and
abnormal heat/motion were not remotely observed, and no long soak was run.
At this Core-check stage, optional peripherals were not started. The later
authorized servo, CAN/M2006 and BMI088 checks are recorded next. USB hardware
was not run because the current identity remains unassigned and intentionally
fails closed.

### Fresh optional hardware evidence

These tests used either the retained PWM validation image or task-local
disposable harnesses. The retired CAN/BMI088/DBUS release options were not
restored, and no task harness is part of a product source graph.

- PWM/servo:
  - Fresh ELF SHA-256:
    `BC298B1BB221DE881F1EB4E82C3CFE892C919300F86D30A2D039E212C30C3043`.
  - OpenOCD program/verify passed.
  - The bounded `1500 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 1550 -> 1500 us` sequence completed
    5/5 steps with `faulted=0`, `output_enabled=0`; TIM1 `CR1=0`,
    `CCER=0` after completion.
  - Physical servo movement was not observed by Codex.
- CAN/M2006:
  - Task-local ELF SHA-256:
    `ED16B2CE2CE759D9A16E24E7B41BD93B554D4394D50F323D6370B82B3E548BA3`.
  - It linked the current direct `bsp_can.cpp` and unchanged template
    Motor/DJI Device sources.
  - OpenOCD program/verify passed. First-halt telemetry reported RX/TX
    `2328/1148`, last ID `0x203`, error/bus-off/drop/fault `0/0/0/0`,
    ten stable feedback samples, exactly 125 non-zero `+500` cycles, final
    current `0`, complete/faulted `1/0`; CAN1 ESR was `0`.
  - Physical M2006 movement was not observed by Codex.
  - A later explicit five-second follow-up retained the same `+500` command
    and safety guards. Clean-first task-local ELF SHA-256
    `C5A70AAE960321256CD63BFA57177BBAFB816EC8D9D67A67AA1719B17DD43259`
    programmed and verified successfully.
  - The measured command window was exactly 5000 ThreadX ticks at 1000 Hz
    (`start=20`, `end=5020`). Telemetry reported RX/TX `7712/3797`, ID
    `0x203`, error/bus-off/drop/fault `0/0/0/0`, 2501 control cycles, final
    current/speed `0/0`, and complete/faulted `1/0`; CAN1 ESR and the crash
    record were zero.
  - This proves the bounded command and safe final state. Physical rotation,
    sound, load, and temperature during those five seconds were not observable
    by Codex and require the user's confirmation.
- BMI088:
  - Task-local ELF SHA-256:
    `1DD5905EAD92F671B00E898493744A09C17C7875A5EE50B0CC327D3FABAF0DA0`.
  - It linked the current direct `bsp_spi.cpp` and unchanged template BMI088
    Device source; the heater was disabled.
  - SPI init, Device initialized, accel/gyro self-test, and reads all passed.
    Samples advanced `150 -> 251`, changing samples `149 -> 250`, all six axes
    changed, temperature was `32.875 C`, and `faulted=0`.
  - The template Device contains a hidden board dependency:
    `bmi088.cpp` references `GYRO_INT_Pin`, but this F407 IOC defines no
    BMI088 DRDY EXTI label. The polling-only task build used inert
    `GYRO_INT_Pin=0U` and never called the callback API. DRDY integration is
    therefore not validated and the Device is not fully drop-in on this board.
- DBUS:
  - Task-local ELF SHA-256:
    `8327445A9BF23D12B47B15DE9FB21C55595BE26A572BCBDE4EE56669D6846D08`.
  - It linked the current direct `bsp_usart.cpp`, unchanged template
    `msg.cpp`, and unchanged template `dr16.cpp`; the DR16 thread stack
    remained 768 bytes.
  - OpenOCD program/verify passed. The decisive four-second run reported
    heartbeat `434`, RX/update `310/310`, last length `18`,
    init/error/busy `0/0/0`, active source `1`, `offline=0`, and 272 motion
    samples.
  - Current and latched axes included `right_y=-0.286363631`,
    `left_x=0.0166666675`, and `left_y=-0.683333337`, proving live non-zero
    DR16 data reached the template parser.
  - One intervening 12-second run observed 225 short-frame/error/busy events
    and `offline=1`; repeating the exact artifact returned to healthy frames.
    No fault-handler entry, crash record, or reset was observed. Treat cable
    placement and signal quality as an attended follow-up, not a hidden pass.
- Every optional image was followed by successful Core program/verify. The
  board was left running Core ELF SHA-256
  `EDB72454568B5C719C622B5492BDCDF0B9AB61D1792343FD04D630E7A64A78CA`.

Before publication:

1. Review and commit the `pnx_bsp` change, then push that exact commit.
2. Commit the parent changes and gitlinks; do not create new Device/Lib/Module
   branches.
3. Verify a fresh `git clone --recurse-submodules`.
4. Re-run the five retained presets and 23 host tests from that clone.
5. Run remote CI. Product-specific USB and optional-peripheral hardware
   validation remain separate attended gates.

## Context

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Repository: `C:\Users\USER\Desktop\RM\rm校內賽\2026\firmware\pnx_f4_minimal`
- Branch: `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture`
- Firmware commit: `342efc481b7153acc2815ed511139a6c8847ff66`

- Artifact SHA-256: `78C50EBFEE979EAD1332309FEBB7E74232310EA94F0B45C58CBCE34925688DF5`
- Operator: user, attended
- Pre-existing local item: untracked `testing.md`

## Objective

Validate the F407 Core Debug image on the DJI C-board without changing the
frozen P0 firmware baseline or exercising motor, servo, CAN, USB, IMU, or
other peripheral closures.

## Actual changes

No firmware, configuration, IOC, generated source, preset, submodule, or Git
history changes were made.

## Hardware and tools

- Target detected as STM32F407, Cortex-M4 r0p1, 1024 KiB Flash.
- Probe detected as Horco CMSIS-DAP v2, serial `482752132243`.
- OpenOCD 0.12.0 used with `interface/cmsis-dap.cfg` and
  `target/stm32f4x.cfg`.
- Arm GNU GDB from toolchain 13.3.Rel1 was used for breakpoint and register
  observations.
- An M2006 on CAN1 controller ID 3 and an A2 servo were physically connected,
  but the Core image sent no motor command and enabled no servo PWM.

## Verified evidence

- Flash programming completed and OpenOCD reported `Verified OK`.
- Reset PC was `0x08006214`, symbol `Reset_Handler`.
- Hardware breakpoints observed, in startup order:
  - `main`
  - `tx_application_define`
  - `app_start`
- Steady-state PC samples were in ThreadX `__tx_ts_wait`.
- DWT was enabled with `DWT_CTRL=0x40000001`.
- Steady DWT samples increased:
  - `0x5D564709 -> 0x675F0987`
  - final samples `0x2F06B20A -> 0x362A5DA1 -> 0x3C969AE7`
- After `reset run`, the target returned to ThreadX `__tx_ts_wait`; DWT was
  enabled again.
- GPIOH ODR changed from `0x00000000` to `0x00000800`, directly observing the
  PH11 green-indicator output transition.
- User observation:
  - `GREEN_LED=BLINKING`
  - `M2006=NO_MOVEMENT`
  - `A2_SERVO=NO_MOVEMENT`
- No HardFault, halt, unexpected reset, motor movement, or servo movement was
  observed during the attended smoke interval.
- OpenOCD was shut down after explicitly resuming the target; the MCU was left
  running independently.

## Failed attempts and resolution

- The initial OpenOCD attempt used `interface/stlink.cfg` and failed at probe
  open. Windows and pyOCD enumeration showed that the connected probe was
  CMSIS-DAP, not ST-Link. Using `interface/cmsis-dap.cfg` resolved the issue.
- GDB could not reopen the ELF through the repository's non-ASCII path. The
  ELF was copied to an ASCII temporary path and its SHA-256 was verified equal
  before use.
- A combined breakpoint run exceeded the F407 hardware-breakpoint budget
  because `HardFault_Handler` resolved to two locations. The startup points
  were then observed with a smaller sequential breakpoint set.

## Result

`ATTENDED-F407-CORE-HARDWARE-VALIDATION`: **PASS for the shortened attended
Core smoke scope**.

The planned 30-minute soak was shortened by user direction. Approximately a
few minutes of runtime plus a 90-second uninterrupted soak were observed.
Therefore the 30-minute stability criterion remains **NOT RUN** and must not
be cited as verified.

## Remaining scope

- Core 30-minute stability: `UNVERIFIED`
- USB CDC hardware: `UNVERIFIED`
- CAN RX/TX and motor control: `UNVERIFIED`
- Servo PWM: `UNVERIFIED`
- IMU, UART/DBUS, and concurrent-peripheral runtime: `UNVERIFIED`

## Rollback point

Git HEAD remains
`342efc481b7153acc2815ed511139a6c8847ff66`; the authorized USB changes are
uncommitted working-tree changes.

## USB CDC hardware follow-up

### Authorized configuration change

- The user explicitly authorized removal of the CMake rejection of VID
  `0x0483` and use of the existing RM26_F4 USB identity.
- At the initial identity-validation stage, the only production-source
  working-tree change was removal of that rejection block from
  `CMakeLists.txt`. The later separately authorized ZLP fix is recorded below.
- Configured identity:
  - VID `0x0483`
  - PID `0x5710`
  - manufacturer `STMicroelectronics`
  - product `Pikachu`
  - serial `LXYCAT`
- No IOC, generated source, preset, submodule, commit, remote, or tag was
  changed.

### Build and programming evidence

- Preset: `f407-usb-cdc-debug`
- Build: PASS with zero compiler/linker warnings.
- Pre-fix artifact: `build/f407-usb-cdc-debug/pnx_embedded.elf`
- Pre-fix artifact SHA-256:
  `05DD0BE20E8AC9C3D54E2E5D199D0958214ADCCCBE4B8DCEF5CF9BE6AB54D419`
- OpenOCD programming and verify: PASS.
- The target continued running ThreadX with DWT increasing and the PH11
  heartbeat active before the USB data cable was inserted.

### Host and CDC evidence

- Horco probe CDC enumerated as COM12.
- Target enumerated as COM17 with hardware ID
  `USB\VID_0483&PID_5710\LXYCAT`, product `Pikachu`, and repeated PnP status
  `OK`.
- CDC echo:
  - 1 byte: PASS
  - 16 bytes: PASS
  - 63 bytes: PASS
  - 64 bytes: FAIL; 64 bytes sent, zero bytes returned before host timeout
- Binary payload, 100-packet sequence, reconnect, reset/re-enumeration, and
  sustained-runtime tests were not run after the first boundary failure.
- Fault-register inspection after the failure showed CFSR, HFSR, DFSR, and
  AFSR all zero; the PC was in ThreadX `__tx_ts_wait`.

### Read-only diagnosis

- F407 carries USBX 6.1.10; its callback bulk-IN path sends an exact
  max-packet-size payload with equal transfer and host lengths and has no
  automatic ZLP support.
- `pnx_template` carries USBX 6.4.0, defines
  `UX_DEVICE_CLASS_CDC_ACM_WRITE_AUTO_ZLP`, and its callback bulk-IN path asks
  the stack to append a ZLP at this boundary.
- The observed 1/16/63-byte pass and exact 64-byte timeout are therefore
  consistent with a missing terminating ZLP. This is a strong causal
  inference, not yet a verified fix.

### Pre-fix USB result

`ATTENDED-F407-USB-CDC-HARDWARE-VALIDATION`: **PARTIAL PASS / BLOCKED**.

Enumeration and short CDC RX/TX echo passed. The required 64-byte boundary did
not pass, so USB CDC is not accepted and the CAN vertical slice must not be
started from this firmware state. No automatic source fix was made.

## P0 F407 USB ZLP boundary fix

### Authorization and scope

- The user explicitly authorized `P0-F407-USB-ZLP-BOUNDARY-FIX` and attended
  hardware revalidation.
- Production changes:
  - `boards/dji_c_board_f407/pnx_backends/usb_tx_completion.hpp`
  - `boards/dji_c_board_f407/pnx_backends/usb_backend.cpp`
- Test changes:
  - `tests/host/CMakeLists.txt`
  - `tests/host/usb_contract_host_tests.cpp`
- The fix adds a board-local asynchronous completion phase. An exact,
  successfully completed 64-byte CDC IN payload schedules one zero-length
  callback write before the common BSP receives the final completion.
- IOC, generated code, vendor USBX, common USB API, presets, submodules, CAN,
  motor, servo, IMU, commit history, remotes, and tags were not changed.

### TDD evidence

- Initial regression build failed because the completion policy did not
  exist.
- A deliberately non-ZLP scaffold then built, and
  `usb_f407_zlp_boundary` failed on the expected 64-byte action assertion.
- After implementation, the focused test passed.
- A second regression for a partial 64-byte completion failed before the
  guard and passed after requiring `actual == requested` before ZLP.
- Final host result: 12/12 PASS.

### Build evidence

- Fresh configure and build passed for:
  - `f407-debug`
  - `f407-release`
  - `f407-usb-cdc-debug`
  - `f407-usb-cdc-release`
- Compiler/linker warnings: zero.
- The Core source graph contains no `usb_backend.cpp` compile entry.
- Final artifact:
  `build/f407-usb-cdc-debug/pnx_embedded.elf`
- Final size: 2,281,708 bytes.
- Final SHA-256:
  `67E0989FB74EE5B0AC3B6C37550E52072892BE57198AE60BC0DF92D82F64B3EC`
- Final OpenOCD programming and verify: PASS.

### Hardware validation

- Final artifact enumeration:
  `USB\VID_0483&PID_5710\LXYCAT`, COM17, PnP status `OK`.
- Final artifact:
  - 64-byte binary echo: PASS.
  - 20/20 mixed echo sequence using 1/16/63/64-byte payloads: PASS.
  - SWD `SYSRESETREQ`, re-enumeration, and post-reset 64-byte echo: PASS.
- The immediately preceding implementation artifact additionally passed:
  - 1/16/63/64-byte boundary echo.
  - 64-byte binary echo.
  - 100/100 mixed packets, including 25 exact 64-byte packets.
  - Physical USB power/data cold disconnect and reconnect followed by a
    64-byte echo.
  - 15.005 seconds of continuous 64-byte bidirectional echo:
    15,909 packets and 1,018,176 bytes in each direction.
- The final source change after those extended checks only guards the
  partial-success error path; the final artifact was rebuilt, programmed,
  verified, and rechecked as listed above.

### Hardware/tool issue

- The first final-programming attempt reached the F407 but the Horco probe
  failed its physical SRST command with
  `CMD_DAP_SWJ_PINS failed / Unable to reset target`.
- A diagnostic attach with `reset_config none` read PC `0x0800F8BC`, proving
  SWD and target power were valid.
- Programming with physical SRST disabled and the STM32F4 target's Cortex-M
  `SYSRESETREQ` path completed and verified successfully.
- OpenOCD was shut down; final process count was zero.

### Final USB result

`P0-F407-USB-ZLP-BOUNDARY-FIX`: **PASS in the authorized shortened scope**.

The original exact-64-byte failure is reproduced, explained, regression
tested, and verified fixed on hardware. USB CDC no longer blocks beginning a
separately authorized CAN vertical slice. No commit or push was performed.

## F407 CAN1/M2006 vertical slice

Status: **PASS in the authorized attended scope**.

### Architecture changes

- Added the board-local STM32F407 bxCAN backend:
  `boards/dji_c_board_f407/pnx_backends/can_backend.cpp`.
- Reused the existing `pnx_bsp/can` contract without modifying it.
- Added the dedicated `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006` application closure. Core and USB
  Debug Ninja graphs contain none of the CAN backend, CAN BSP, DJI motor, or
  CAN/M2006 application sources.
- The application uses the existing `m2006` and `djimotorhandler` classes
  directly. It does not restore `dji_motor_service`, an arm registry/token,
  USB arm commands, a factory, or a manager.
- Removed the remaining H7-specific default
  `bsp::can::bus::fdcan1` from
  `pnx_devices/motors/motor/include/motor.hpp`; the default is now the
  MCU-neutral `bsp::can::bus::none`.
- `pnx_devices` is a detached-HEAD submodule at
  `8a6783e63d77a15940aea8245bbe2eb13a2f2b11`. The one-line `fdcan1` correction
  is an uncommitted submodule working-tree modification; no submodule pointer
  was changed.
- A2 PWM was not initialized or enabled.

### Software validation

- Host tests: 18/18 PASS:
  - USB contract: 12.
  - CAN contract: 4.
  - M2006 template path: 1.
  - bounded one-shot sequence: 1.
- F407 CAN backend source acceptance: PASS.
- Embedded Debug builds:
  - Core: PASS, CAN/M2006 closure absent.
  - USB CDC: PASS, CAN/M2006 closure absent.
  - CAN/M2006: PASS, compiler/linker warnings zero.
- Non-generated/non-vendor source search found zero
  `bsp::can::bus::fdcan1`/`fdcan1` hits.

### Attended hardware validation

- Final CAN/M2006 ELF:
  `build/f407-can-m2006-debug/pnx_embedded.elf`
- Size: 1,572,932 bytes.
- SHA-256:
  `02C02F6A2B106B51F96E6A871DEFCC7DBAFE80747B6E44BC2C7AEB386BD3591D`
- OpenOCD programming and verify: PASS.
- First non-intrusive final telemetry snapshot:
  - heartbeat: 4,583
  - CAN RX: 9,310
  - CAN TX: 4,583
  - last ID: `0x203`
  - error/drop/fault epoch: `0/0/0`
  - non-zero pulse cycles: 125
  - final commanded current: 0
  - complete/faulted: `1/0`
- The operator observed one very small, brief M2006 movement on the immediately
  preceding implementation artifact using the same `+500`/250 ms sequence.
- An earlier symbol-read attempt halted the target and reproduced the known
  debugger-induced FIFO overflow. That observation was discarded. The final
  telemetry above was captured on the first halt after the final run and had
  zero CAN error/drop/fault.

### Safe restoration

- The board was restored to the normal Core Debug image.
- Restored Core ELF size: 1,418,560 bytes.
- Restored Core SHA-256:
  `0B34622FE890F2BDF665F26D1CEF5120D139A6D365F66CAEF6A11993C2F529F2`
- Core programming and verify: PASS.
- OpenOCD was shut down; no OpenOCD process remained.
- No commit, push, tag, remote change, IOC regeneration, generated-source
  edit, or Vault write was performed.

## F407 TIM1/PE11 servo vertical slice

Status: **PASS in the authorized attended scope**.

### Architecture changes

- Replaced the HAL-coupled shared PWM API with a board-neutral contract:
  opaque channel identity plus `start`, `stop`, `set_period_us`,
  `set_pulse_us`, and `set_duty`.
- The F407 board backend alone owns TIM1, channel 2, PE11 AF1, clock setup,
  HAL calls, and teardown.
- Added a dedicated `PNX_ENABLE_PWM_A2` application closure. Core, USB, and
  CAN Ninja graphs contain zero `pwm_backend.cpp` references.
- The board IOC and CubeMX-generated sources were not modified or regenerated.
- The test application has no motor layer, service, factory, registry, or
  persistent control interface.

### Software validation

- Host tests: 20/20 PASS, including the PWM contract and exact bounded servo
  sequence.
- Embedded Debug builds PASS with zero observed compiler/linker warnings:
  Core, USB CDC, CAN/M2006, and PWM/A2.
- PWM/A2 ELF SHA-256:
  `C3BF015E8354CD31369A031419CB676CFA33D92AAF425E32B61FE893D0E5EC5A`.

### Attended hardware validation

- OpenOCD program/verify/reset: PASS.
- Commanded sequence:
  `1500 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 1550 -> 1500 us`, followed by a final center hold
  and output disable.
- Operator observation: the connected servo moved.
- Final telemetry:
  heartbeat `5`, step count `5`, pulse `0`, complete `1`, faulted `0`,
  output enabled `0`.
- Final register snapshot showed the TIM1 peripheral clock disabled after
  completion.

### Safe restoration

- The board was restored to the normal Core Debug image.
- Restored Core ELF SHA-256:
  `6D0CEFDCD1CE31DD4E0074813B4596912B2AFE6B4D6E278B0AE97EC83352964C`.
- Core programming and verify: PASS.
- No OpenOCD process remained.
- No commit, push, tag, remote change, IOC/generated edit, or Vault write was
  performed.

### Known integration boundary

- `pnx_bsp` is still at detached HEAD
  `f61e8ac8ac4b75d93b021ec32a8ecf56fc36a73b`; the PWM contract change is an
  uncommitted submodule working-tree modification.
- Dormant BMI088 code still names the former timer-specific PWM channels.
  Its board binding must be migrated when the BMI088 vertical slice begins;
  it was intentionally not pulled into this servo-only product graph.

## F407 shared-peripheral completion and provenance

Status: **software complete; BMI088 hardware PASS; DBUS hardware deferred by
operator direction**.

This section supersedes the earlier notes that the shared submodules were
dirty detached worktrees and that the BMI088 device driver still contained
timer-specific or H7-specific bindings.

### Architecture result

- `pnx_bsp` SPI, PWM, and Flash contracts are board-neutral. STM32 HAL types
  and calls exist only in C-board backends.
- The F407 SPI backend owns SPI1 Mode 3 and the PA7/PB3/PB4 pins. Board
  composition owns PA4 accelerometer CS and PB0 gyro CS.
- BMI088 register transport is independent of STM32 and has explicit injected
  bus and chip selects. The higher-level BMI088 driver also injects its
  optional heater PWM channel and data-ready attachment hook.
- The dormant WS2812 driver no longer hardcodes H7 `spi6`.
- F407 Flash sector geometry and HAL erase/program logic are board-local.
  No destructive Flash hardware test was run because this repository has no
  reserved test sector.
- H7 memory-bank labels `RAM_D1/D2/D3` were removed from shared code. Actual
  DMA buffers use `PNX_DMA_BUFFER`; ordinary objects use normal BSS; retained
  diagnostics use `.noinit`.
- The F407 USART backend uses generated USART handles only below the board
  boundary. The DR16 decoder parses the 18-byte wire format explicitly rather
  than relying on packed compiler bitfields.
- The automatic M2006 pulse image is no longer a normal preset. It is
  available only through the explicit
  `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006_VALIDATION=ON` attended-validation switch.
- The default motor CAN bus is the board-neutral `bsp::can::bus::none`; no
  `fdcan1` reference remains in shared source.

### Formal submodule provenance

The following local branches and commits were created. They have **not** been
pushed:

- `pnx_bsp` `refactor/f407-portable-peripherals`:
  `899c0b491ec81e48ba8ed66ae90d451fb2bddc1b`
- `pnx_devices` `refactor/f407-portable-devices`:
  `e90601d8676922db954c90a06de97ef82d87bf01`
- `pnx_libs` `refactor/f407-memory-semantics`:
  `205217a42ac4e1e556e63f594eb7671f47e0e2b9`
- `pnx_modules` `refactor/f407-remoter-protocol`:
  `deaae6720a6051c0276b1ffbeb3fc0fc875456dd`

The parent integration records these four SHAs as gitlinks. The pre-existing
untracked `testing.md` remains outside Git.

### Final software validation

- Clean embedded builds: 7/7 PASS:
  `f407-debug`, `f407-release`, `f407-usb-cdc-debug`,
  `f407-usb-cdc-release`, `f407-pwm-a2-debug`,
  `f407-bmi088-debug`, and `f407-dbus-rx-debug`.
- Explicit attended CAN validation build: PASS using
  `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006_VALIDATION=ON`.
- Host tests: 25/25 PASS, including USB, CAN, M2006 sequence, PWM, SPI,
  BMI088 transport, Flash contract, USART contract, and DR16 protocol.
- Compiler/linker warnings observed in the clean builds: zero.
- Core Ninja graph optional closure: none.
- Shared-source leakage scan found zero STM32 HAL types, `stm32h7`, `fdcan1`,
  old timer/SPI enum bindings, or `RAM_D1/D2/D3` names in
  `pnx_bsp`, `pnx_devices`, `pnx_libs`, and `pnx_modules`.
- `git diff --check`: PASS; Git only reported the repository's existing
  LF-to-CRLF checkout policy notices.

Final artifact hashes:

- Core Debug:
  `4736B2E1B0EFC47CD2A3D94CB10112EBA362DC57FADF38188BAB3B5A8C427BE1`
- BMI088 Debug:
  `F7E32A275CDE72D309700A97285DDAB1557A777BE3E524A35F0AFA4FF2535C02`
- DBUS RX Debug:
  `2E86C49C6FBF7AC54FDCD88F66611AF125CB6DCD9AE4D7F692854F055E01FF6A`
- Explicit CAN validation:
  `24B7165407F9EF2E8727CFE4AE1EC192CC3F8BDC59F6C586856A6ABAE596A458`

### Final BMI088 hardware evidence

- Final BMI088 artifact program/verify/reset: PASS.
- Runtime symbol:
  `demo::cboard::imu_bmi088::runtime` at `0x2000381C`.
- Snapshot A:
  heartbeat/sample/change `0x7DB/0x7DB/0x7DA`, IDs `0x1E/0x0F`,
  complete/faulted `1/0`.
- Snapshot B one second later:
  heartbeat/sample/change `0x865/0x865/0x864`, IDs `0x1E/0x0F`,
  complete/faulted `1/0`.
- All six raw axes changed between the two snapshots.

Result:
`SPI1 -> BMI088 device ID -> accelerometer/gyroscope raw data` is **PASS on
hardware** for the final source state.

### Final safe restoration and deferred evidence

- The board was restored to the final Core Debug artifact.
- Core program/verify/reset: PASS.
- Final Core sample: PC in ThreadX PendSV, DWT control/counter
  `0x40000001/0x1816AC86`, GPIOH ODR `0x800`.
- OpenOCD process count after resume/shutdown: zero.
- `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME`: **NOT RUN by explicit operator direction**.
- UART3/DBUS hardware behavior must not be presented as verified; only its
  backend build, USART contract, parser, and remote-module integration are
  verified.
- No remote push, tag, IOC edit, generated-code edit, destructive Flash test,
  CAN output, or PWM output was performed during this completion pass.

## 2026-07-29 architecture release-candidate cleanup

### Fact: scope and intent

This change is a narrow release-hygiene cleanup on top of the recorded F407
vertical-slice evidence. It does not alter IOC/generated files, startup,
linker, HAL runtime code, SPI1/BMI088 source, TIM1/PWM source, USB runtime
code, or application behaviour.

- Removed the unused H7-template SPI2/SPI6/TIM3/TIM12 capability parsing and
  generated SPI/PWM configuration from `configs/cmake/import_ioc.cmake` and
  `configs/cmake/generate_config.cmake`.
- Removed the unselected Flash public/backend closure and F4 Flash HAL source
  files from the default Core source graph. The board-local Flash backend is
  retained for a future explicit Flash slice; it remains unverified on
  hardware because no reserved destructive-test sector exists.
- Made every normal CMake preset explicitly set all optional application
  selectors. An attended CAN configure can therefore no longer silently
  persist into a subsequently selected normal Core/USB/PWM/BMI/DBUS preset.
- Updated the root README, repository rules, and board ownership note. The
  documents distinguish product images from attended validation closures and
  give one authoritative location for manual SPI1/TIM1 ownership.

### Fact: fresh software validation after the cleanup

On 2026-07-29, from a fresh CMake configure directory for each normal preset:

- 7/7 embedded builds PASS: `f407-debug`, `f407-release`,
  `f407-usb-cdc-debug`, `f407-usb-cdc-release`, `f407-pwm-a2-debug`,
  `f407-bmi088-debug`, and `f407-dbus-rx-debug`.
- The explicit attended CAN/M2006 image PASSed in its own binary directory
  `build/f407-can-m2006-debug` with all other optional closures OFF.
- Host tests: 25/25 PASS.
- `ninja -C build/f407-debug -t commands` contains none of
  `flash_backend`, `bsp_flash`, `usb_backend`, `can_backend`, `spi_backend`,
  `pwm_backend`, `bmi088`, or `usart_backend`.
- The removed generated-configuration identifiers have zero matches under
  `configs`; `git diff --check` PASSed.

### Inference: release status

The source tree is suitable for an **F407 architecture release candidate**:
the normal Core graph is now materially minimal, configuration authority is
clear, and optional hardware slices do not leak into it. The prior hardware
evidence remains relevant because this cleanup did not change the exercised
runtime code, but no new binary was programmed in this cleanup pass.

### Remaining release gates

- `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN`; DBUS remains software-validated only.
- The remote fresh-clone/submodule retrieval gate passed at
  `4a3a101a3d201b3d61cad71df730ed059559b7e0`; rerun it after any later
  source, submodule, preset, or toolchain-affecting commit.
- A public release still requires a repository-owner decision on LICENSE,
  NOTICE, and third-party distribution terms. No legal metadata is invented
  by this engineering cleanup.

### Fact: submodule clone URL correction

The initial remote fresh-clone attempt reached the parent and public
`pnx_bsp`, but failed before checkout because `pnx_devices`, `pnx_libs`, and
`pnx_modules` were recorded with unavailable `git@github.com:HKUSTGZ-ROBOMASTER-PNX/...`
SSH URLs. Their tested release remotes are the corresponding
`https://github.com/shiuhou/...` repositories, which already contain the
recorded F407 branches. `.gitmodules` is therefore corrected to these HTTPS
URLs before the final fresh-clone retry. This is release provenance repair,
not an architecture or firmware behaviour change.

### Fact: final remote reproducibility evidence

After the URL correction, a clean clone of
`refactor/f407-minimal-architecture@4a3a101a3d201b3d61cad71df730ed059559b7e0`
with `--recurse-submodules` completed from `origin`. It checked out exactly:

- `pnx_bsp@899c0b491ec81e48ba8ed66ae90d451fb2bddc1b`
- `pnx_devices@e90601d8676922db954c90a06de97ef82d87bf01`
- `pnx_libs@205217a42ac4e1e556e63f594eb7671f47e0e2b9`
- `pnx_modules@deaae6720a6051c0276b1ffbeb3fc0fc875456dd`

In that independent checkout, all seven normal embedded presets and the
isolated CAN attended image built successfully; `ctest` reported 25/25 host
tests PASS. The only observed transient was one HTTPS connection timeout while
cloning `pnx_modules`; Git retried automatically and checkout completed.

### Fact: final remote gate revalidation

On 2026-07-29, a second independent recursive checkout of
`origin/refactor/f407-minimal-architecture@957ce253a44d229b1aced496e8381956ace57bf0`
checked out the same four published submodule SHAs. From empty build
directories it configured and built all seven named presets, then built the
isolated `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006_VALIDATION=ON` image. Native host configuration
used the root CMake project with `PNX_HOST_TESTS=ON`; `ctest` reported 25/25
PASS. No hardware was connected or operated.

Result: the remote fresh-clone gate is **PASS** for `957ce25`. A first
attempted host configuration against `tests/host` directly was invalid because
that directory is a subdirectory, not a standalone CMake project; it was not
a firmware build or test failure.

## 2026-07-29 team-internal RC documentation and local revalidation

### Actual changes

- Retained `HANDOFF.md` in the repository as the detailed evidence record.
- Moved the transient `testing.md` checklist to the parent `firmware/`
  directory; it is not tracked by this repository and is not release evidence.
- Updated `README.md` for team onboarding only:
  - defined `backend`, `closure`, and `fail-closed` at first use;
  - added a high-level repository tree and the actual CMake composition flow;
  - removed references to transient handoff/testing files and public-release
    legal metadata that are out of scope for this team-internal repository.

No firmware source, public interface, IOC/generated file, preset, submodule,
toolchain configuration, or hardware state was changed. Documentation commits,
remote synchronization, and tag state are recorded by Git history.

### Fresh local software validation

Working tree under test: `7f0129ad6a789e4cb466a51697d0bad2a10854d1` plus the
document-only `README.md` modification above. No hardware was connected or
operated.

- Fresh configure and build PASS for all normal presets using
  `cmake --fresh --preset <preset>` followed by
  `cmake --build --preset <preset> --parallel 4`:
  `f407-debug`, `f407-release`, `f407-usb-cdc-debug`,
  `f407-usb-cdc-release`, `f407-pwm-a2-debug`, `f407-bmi088-debug`, and
  `f407-dbus-rx-debug`.
- Fresh isolated CAN/M2006 configure and build PASS in
  `build/f407-can-m2006-debug`, with USB, PWM, BMI088, and DBUS selectors OFF
  and `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006_VALIDATION=ON`.
- Fresh native host configure/build PASS in `build/host-release-check` with
  `PNX_HOST_TESTS=ON`; `ctest --output-on-failure` reported **25/25 PASS**.
- `ninja -C build/f407-debug -t commands` contained none of
  `usb_backend`, `can_backend`, `pwm_backend`, `spi_backend`, `bmi088`,
  `usart_backend`, `bsp_flash`, or `flash_backend`.
- Shared-layer leakage scan across `pnx_bsp`, `pnx_devices`, `pnx_libs`, and
  `pnx_modules` found no `stm32h7`, `fdcan`, `RAM_D[0-3]`, STM32 HAL, GPIO
  handle, or peripheral-handle identifiers.
- `git diff --check`: PASS. Git emitted only the existing LF-to-CRLF checkout
  notice for `README.md`.

### Remaining boundary

This revalidation is software-only. `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN`, the shortened
Core smoke scope, long soak, concurrent-peripheral runtime, and destructive
Flash testing retain their previously recorded evidence status. No new
hardware claim is made here.

## 2026-07-29 attended DBUS live-frame validation

### Actual source corrections

- `pnx_modules/remoter/include/remoter.hpp` increases only the DR16 ThreadX
  stack from 768 to 1536 bytes. The original image entered the registered
  ThreadX stack-error handler with the DR16 `TX_THREAD` control block as the
  context; its saved stack pointer was below its effective stack start.
- `demo/cboard/dbus_rx/dbus_rx.cpp` creates the message subscription in the
  already-running monitor thread rather than in `app_start()`. `app_start()`
  is invoked by `tx_application_define()`, where `msg::subscribe()` cannot
  wait on its ThreadX mutex. This is a lifecycle correction; no message-bus
  API or ThreadX policy was changed.

### Validation facts

- `f407-dbus-rx-debug` rebuilt successfully with RAM usage 51,696 B / 128 KiB
  (39.44%) and no observed build warnings.
- `ctest --test-dir build/host --output-on-failure`: **25/25 PASS**.
- The attended DBUS ELF SHA-256 was
  `C924BB2C35829997F9E8B8642F35CFF984B375C42F7106DF30F382B14C94FA67`;
  OpenOCD program and verify both passed on the STM32F407.
- With the receiver DBUS signal connected to USART3 RX (PC11) and common
  ground, live telemetry reached `offline=0`, `init_failed=0`, and the UART
  DMA reported 18-byte frames. The counters advanced from
  heartbeat/update `283436/44397` to `286047/46263`.
- Operator stick movement produced decoded values
  `right_x=-0.215151519` and `right_y=-0.506060600`; the remaining two axes
  were centered for that sample. This is physical evidence for receiver ->
  PC11 -> USART3 DMA -> DR16 decode -> message bus -> monitor telemetry.
- The board was restored to `f407-debug`; Core ELF SHA-256
  `78F5C5C7B8A9E920370EAE43973F913988F1B6838EE81594C945FB78497A5463` was
  programmed and verified successfully.

### Status

`DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=PASS`. This validation did not exercise USB, CAN, PWM,
BMI088, or Flash.

## 2026-07-29 release-hardening follow-up

### Actual changes

- `README.md` now records DBUS RX attended live-frame PASS, labels its preset
  as an attended validation image, and documents a local CMSIS-DAP/OpenOCD/GDB
  procedure. `.vscode/launch.json` remains intentionally local and ignored.
- `boards/dji_c_board_f407/README.md` records the composition rule discovered
  in DBUS validation: `app_start()` runs in `tx_application_define()` before
  application thread scheduling, so potentially suspending ThreadX calls
  belong in thread entries.
- `pnx_bsp/usart/src/bsp_usart.cpp` classifies a `restart_rx()` backend
  `busy` result as `busy_count`, not `error_count`, matching the existing
  transmit diagnostic semantics. The circular DMA may already be active when
  a DR16 timeout asks for a restart; this is contention, not a transport
  failure.
- `tests/host/usart_contract_host_tests.cpp` and its fake backend now cover
  that busy/error diagnostic distinction. The focused test was observed to
  fail before the production change and pass afterwards.
- `.github/workflows/f407-ci.yml` adds the smallest remote gate: recursive
  checkout, host CTest, F407 Core build, and F407 DBUS build. It uses only
  `actions/checkout@v7` with `contents: read` permission.

### Fresh local validation

- All seven normal embedded presets configured and built successfully:
  `f407-debug`, `f407-release`, `f407-usb-cdc-debug`,
  `f407-usb-cdc-release`, `f407-pwm-a2-debug`, `f407-bmi088-debug`, and
  `f407-dbus-rx-debug`.
- The isolated `PNX_ENABLE_CAN_M2006_VALIDATION=ON` image configured and
  built successfully with all other optional selectors OFF.
- Native host configuration/build succeeded; `ctest --test-dir build/host
  --output-on-failure` reported **25/25 PASS**. The focused USART contract
  test also passed after the red/green change.
- `git diff --check` passed. No hardware was operated during this follow-up.

### Remaining boundary

The GitHub Actions workflow has not run yet because it is uncommitted and
unpushed. Before publication, commit and push `pnx_bsp` and `pnx_modules`,
verify both remote SHAs, then commit/push the parent gitlinks and require one
successful remote CI run plus a fresh recursive clone gate.

## 2026-07-29 CI authentication and release gate

### Actual changes

- `.github/workflows/f407-ci.yml` now supplies the repository-managed
  read-only submodule token to both recursive `actions/checkout@v7` steps.
  This is required because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the parent repository
  cannot read the private sibling submodules.

### Remote validation facts

- Parent commit `648da10df13acd93b16053eb2d2921539b8fe7a3` was pushed to
  `origin/refactor/f407-minimal-architecture`.
- GitHub Actions run `30448274030` completed successfully:
  <https://github.com/shiuhou/pnx_newtemplate_F4/actions/runs/30448274030>.
- Its `host-tests` job completed recursive checkout, configured and built the
  host target, and ran CTest successfully.
- Its `f407-builds` job completed recursive checkout, installed the GNU Arm
  toolchain, and built both `f407-debug` and `f407-dbus-rx-debug` successfully.

### Scope and remaining boundary

- This change only authenticates CI checkout. It does not alter firmware,
  public interfaces, generated code, CMake presets, submodule gitlinks, or
  hardware behavior.
- The CI secret value is intentionally not recorded in this repository.
- With the remote CI gate now passing, the next release action is to create an
  architecture RC tag from the final documentation commit. A production
  release still requires an owner decision on licensing and USB product
  identity.

The Vault was not modified.
