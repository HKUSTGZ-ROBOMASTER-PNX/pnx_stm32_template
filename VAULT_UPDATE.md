# Proposed Vault Update: F407 Core Hardware Validation

This file is a proposal only. The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-08-30 F407 selective dependency-convergence proposal

- Record local F407 authority as `pnx_template/F4_version`,
  `pnx_bsp/F4_version_bsp`, and `pnx_modules/fix/f407-ps2-stack`; devices and
  libraries continue to use their shared main branches.
- Record local pins BSP `ee59c97`, modules merge `dffaca9`, devices `5c418a4`,
  and libs `e7c3e7a`. The modules merge absorbs main `5be2240` while retaining
  the F407 PS2 1536 B stack delta.
- Record the explicit exclusion of the H7 PWM heating lease: it depends on
  H7 TIM3_CH4, TIM6 DMA, Cortex-M7 DCache and D2 RAM. No H7 generated binding,
  IOC, HAL, timer/DMA, startup or linker source was imported.
- Record fresh software evidence: focused contracts **6/6 PASS**, full Host
  **37/37 PASS**, six F407 presets fresh configure/build/link PASS, and all six
  selected command graphs contain zero DM IMU/referee/H7 heating closure.
- Record `HARDWARE=NOT_RUN`, `PUSH=NOT_RUN`, and `VAULT=NOT_MODIFIED`.
- Keep the vehicle synchronization, J3 `servo_pe14=900`, hardware validation,
  modules publication and parent publication behind separate user review.

## 2026-08-06 F407 official PS2 hardware-validation proposal

- Record the approved integration boundary: keep the F407 parent and Direct
  BSP, do not merge the H723 `pnx_template/main` parent, and update only
  `pnx_modules` from `8ba925b` to published
  `fix/f407-ps2-stack@42a4b35`, based directly on `main@44ff9ab`; retain
  `f3a3274` as the original official PS2 mapping provenance.
- Record the new isolated `f407-ps2-debug` closure: physical C-board UART2 ->
  MCU USART1 RX DMA (PA9/PB7) -> F407 Direct USART BSP -> official PS2 parser
  -> Remoter unified state -> debugger
  telemetry. Existing Core, USB, and PWM images do not acquire this closure.
- Record the official API impact: PS2 link/buttons/edges/event count now live
  in the nested/unified `remoter::state`; `ps2_state` retains raw axes, frame
  count, signal count, and last signal tick.
- Record config fail-closed behavior for missing RX DMA and report/remoter UART
  conflicts, plus per-UART generated initialization that retains USART1 only
  in the PS2 ELF.
- Record fresh software evidence: Host CTest **37/37 PASS**; six F407 presets
  configure/build/link PASS with zero warnings; non-PS2 PS2-closure source
  counts are zero; PS2 counts are one each; shared legacy RAM sections are
  explicitly placed in F407 RAM.
- Record the current software artifact: RAM `55,456 B`, Flash `50,856 B`;
  ELF SHA-256
  `7950C1561B81C8B037E500EA39629D8FCA89419EE20F2BB114C70E3F0F69E2C0`.
- Record three retained ThreadX stack-fault diagnoses and TDD fixes: the
  validation monitor, unified Remoter service, and PS2 driver stacks are now
  1536 B.
- Record attended hardware PASS on DAP `482752183208`: disconnected `0xAB`,
  connected frames, Cross `0x4000`, left-stick normalized Y `1.0`, raw/unified
  mapping match, and final stack margins of 628/532/508 B. This result belongs
  to precursor artifact
  `F7BE6A16A009118715E53A936762D8F9E6E386604D7A98BA182C2B5B92F436A0`,
  not the current `42a4b35` software artifact.
- Record publication scope: the modules feature branch and parent
  `F4_version` history were authorized for push; modules `main` was not merged
  or changed. No CubeMX regeneration, new hardware operation, motor output, or
  Vault ingestion was performed in the publication task.

## 2026-08-03 Direct BSP source ownership correction proposal

- Record the corrected interpretation of “no backend”: the F407-specific
  `pnx_bsp` branch retains both `*/include` public contracts and `*/src` direct
  F407 implementations. What remains forbidden is the redundant
  `public -> detail::backend_* -> HAL` forwarding chain.
- Record that 15 already-validated implementation/private-support blobs moved
  from the parent Board tree to their owning BSP module without content change.
- Record that parent CubeMX/generated code supplies hardware handles while root
  CMake selects exactly one `pnx_bsp/*/src` implementation per image.
- Record the published BSP result
  `F4_version_bsp@da09febe8f5bfe66993010247d4d6731d0ca492b` and local parent
  functional commit `5f222b68530b135fb46bc3c12de8127ef5fff6f0` that pins it.
- Record fresh post-commit local software evidence: five presets warning-free
  with unchanged RAM/Flash, Host CTest 36/36, dormant peripheral syntax checks
  PASS, source isolation and symbol uniqueness PASS, public-header leakage zero,
  backend forwarding zero and retired selectors fail closed.
- Preserve evidence scope: BSP commit/push is complete; parent push, fresh
  recursive clone, hardware revalidation, tag creation and Vault ingestion were
  not performed.
- Preserve the cleanup-branch caveat: the current tree is directionally cleaner
  than `F4_version`, but earlier cleanup commits retain range-level CRLF
  whitespace findings. The BSP is remotely reproducible; parent publication and
  remote fresh-clone verification remain outstanding.

## 2026-07-30 latest pnx_template main alignment proposal

- Record a local-only comparison and alignment against
  `pnx_template/main@cf6577765358822a1bc57c1ea17fe65a795ceb62`.
- Record exact shared pins:
  `pnx_devices@2349cc108c9ed477ccdcd700e802ea888975cdfd`,
  `pnx_libs@e7c3e7a2b9d825586ab3e0c413877180c4295df8`, and
  `pnx_modules@8ba925b60b11fec511a57622c199b57bb23f8f4e`.
- Record that `pnx_bsp/main` was not adopted because it diverges from the
  Direct BSP branch and leaks Board/HAL dependencies into its USART public
  surface. The F407 branch instead adds only the board-neutral line
  configuration declaration and a direct F407 implementation.
- Record parent config compatibility for disabled-by-default PS2 symbols and
  LK8016/LK9025 model identifiers. PS2, BMI088, AHRS, and Tactical EKF remain
  outside every RC2 image graph.
- Record fresh software evidence: Host CTest **35/35 PASS**; all five F407
  presets PASS with zero warnings and unchanged RAM/Flash; source/symbol
  gates PASS; Arm syntax checks PASS for Direct USART and latest
  PS2/Remoter/DR16/VT03/Referee sources.
- Preserve the deferred BMI088 boundary: the latest Device source still
  requires a Board-owned `GYRO_INT_Pin`/EXTI mapping. No BMI088/AHRS build or
  runtime support is claimed.
- Record that official `pnx_template/F4_version@aafa57c7` already retains the
  same Feishu workflow as main, while H7 USART10/IOC, temporary IMU
  diagnostics, IDE metadata, and PS2 demo composition were intentionally not
  ported.
- Preserve local-only state: no commit, push, tag, remote change, hardware
  operation, or Vault write was performed.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-30 RC2 release-closure proposal

- Record local `pnx_bsp` candidate
  `4d3ce2abb3dee18ad551cb03428563b38e384050`, which removes the shared
  forwarding implementation/contracts while keeping MCU-neutral public
  headers. It is an atomic commit now remotely reachable through official
  `pnx_bsp/F4_version@c83e892d9ba76e2671e8d1c8fbc2939a7a77e9df`;
  the merge tip adds only the official Feishu workflow.
- Record the USB lifecycle contract: `init(ok)` accepts raw config/callback
  ownership, creates required ThreadX resources, and schedules async startup;
  `connected()` means CDC transport usable; startup failures become
  observable fault state; writes are bounded; same-config re-init is
  idempotent and incompatible ownership is rejected.
- Record fresh local evidence: all five retained F407 presets configure,
  compile, and link with zero warnings, exactly one `app_start`, and no
  duplicate strong `bsp::*`; native CTest is **33/33 PASS**; all three retired
  validation selectors fail fast.
- Record the corrected source-graph definition: generated Board source
  presence alone is not Direct-BSP closure leakage. Core links no optional
  CAN/USART/SPI/Flash BSP or consumer closure. CMake derives CAN/USART init
  guards from the existing embedded source list; all five RC2 images compile
  those values as false. Their fresh ELFs contain zero CAN1/CAN2 or
  USART1/3/6 init calls and zero matching init symbols, while generated
  `can.c`/`usart.c` remain dormant compiled capability source.
- Record the corrected repository boundary:
  `H7_REGRESSION=OUT_OF_SCOPE`. F407 and H7 use independent BSP
  implementations and release paths; prior cross-injection results are void
  as F407 RC2 findings.
- Preserve current pre-publication status:
  `H7_REGRESSION=OUT_OF_SCOPE`, `SOURCE_GRAPH_ISOLATION=PASS`,
  `PNX_BSP_PUSH=PASS`, `PARENT_PUSH=NOT_RUN`,
  `FRESH_RECURSIVE_CLONE=NOT_RUN`, `RC2_TAG=NOT_CREATED`,
  `HARDWARE_REVALIDATION=NOT_RUN`.
- Preserve deferred capability status:
  `FLASH_CAPABILITY=UNSUPPORTED_UNTIL_RESERVED_PARTITION`,
  `BMI088_AHRS_CAPABILITY=NOT_IN_RC2_PRODUCT_GRAPH`, and
  `USB_TYPED_ADAPTER=UNSUPPORTED_UNTIL_CONTRACT_FIX`.

The Vault was not modified.

## Pre-RC2 direct F407 BSP proposal — historical

This section records the earlier uncommitted working-tree and hardware
evidence. Its software counts, H7 wording, and publication state are
superseded by the current RC2 release-closure proposal above.

- Record the architecture decision: one HAL-free public BSP contract and one
  F407 source per peripheral that directly defines the public symbols. The
  pure `detail::backend_*` forwarding layer is removed; no H7 work is included.
- Record the reusable-layer boundary: Device and Module code may consume the
  public BSP contract but cannot see F407 HAL handles, pins, DMA or IRQ names.
- Record that `pnx_devices`, `pnx_libs` and `pnx_modules` returned to the exact
  `pnx_template` commits:
  `8a6783e63d77a15940aea8245bbe2eb13a2f2b11`,
  `55bd94060b7be562ce7a6773822a6a4d2bcab9c0`, and
  `a54c493020ba9bcd5b43b99e068a06cdda9dd018`.
- Record that BMI088, DBUS RX and CAN/M2006 validation closures and dependent
  claims were retired because the template gitlinks do not reproduce their
  former APIs.
- Record fresh local software evidence: 23/23 host tests PASS; Core
  Debug/Release, USB Debug/Release and PWM Debug builds PASS; F407 ARM syntax
  checks for dormant CAN/SPI/Flash/USART direct sources and representative
  template Motor/Remoter consumers PASS; source graphs contain no former
  backend directory or retired validation source.
- Record that board-private host-tested policy now publishes USART RX metadata
  before enabling reception and serializes USB connection/TX lifecycle with a
  generation check so callbacks from retired connections are ignored.
- Record the authorized short Core hardware result: clean-first Core Debug
  ELF SHA-256
  `EDB72454568B5C719C622B5492BDCDF0B9AB61D1792343FD04D630E7A64A78CA`
  programmed and verified successfully; reset reached `app_start` twice;
  ThreadX PendSV execution, advancing DWT, and PH11 GPIO state activity were
  observed through SWD.
- Record the authorized optional hardware evidence:
  - PWM/servo machine evidence passed 5/5 bounded steps and disabled TIM1
    output with no fault.
  - Current direct CAN plus unchanged template Motor/DJI Device sources
    received ID `0x203`, completed the guarded `+500`/125-cycle pulse, returned
    current to zero, and reported no CAN error/bus-off/drop/fault.
  - A user-authorized five-second M2006 follow-up retained `+500` and measured
    exactly 5000 ThreadX ticks at 1000 Hz. It received 7712 CAN frames,
    completed 2501 guarded control cycles, returned current and final speed to
    zero, and reported no CAN error/bus-off/drop/fault, ESR, crash, or harness
    fault. Physical rotation and temperature require user observation.
  - Current direct SPI plus unchanged template BMI088 Device polling passed
    chip-ID self-test, accel/gyro reads, changing samples, and valid
    `32.875 C` temperature with the heater disabled.
  - Preserve the BMI088 portability limitation: template `bmi088.cpp`
    references `GYRO_INT_Pin`, which this IOC does not define. The disposable
    polling build used inert `GYRO_INT_Pin=0U`; DRDY was not exercised.
  - Current direct USART plus unchanged template Msg/DR16 sources received
    and parsed live 18-byte DBUS frames. The decisive run reported RX/update
    `310/310`, errors/busy `0/0`, `offline=0`, 272 motion samples, and non-zero
    decoded axes. The unchanged 768-byte DR16 stack showed no crash/fault.
  - Preserve the DBUS limitation: one intervening run observed 225
    short-frame/error/busy events and went offline; repeating the exact
    artifact was healthy. Cable placement and signal quality need attended
    follow-up.
  - Physical actuator motion was not observed by Codex.
- Preserve the evidence boundary:
  `CORE_HARDWARE=PASS_SHORT_DEBUGGER_OBSERVED`,
  `PHYSICAL_LED=NOT_OBSERVED`, `LONG_SOAK=NOT_RUN`,
  `USB_HARDWARE=NOT_RUN_FAIL_CLOSED_UNASSIGNED_IDENTITY`,
  `SERVO_MACHINE_EVIDENCE=PASS`, `CAN_M2006_MACHINE_EVIDENCE=PASS`,
  `BMI088_POLLING=PASS_WITH_DRDY_LIMITATION`,
  `PHYSICAL_ACTUATOR_MOTION=NOT_OBSERVED_BY_CODEX`,
  `DBUS=PASS_WITH_INTERMITTENT_SIGNAL_OBSERVATION`, `H7=NOT_RUN`,
  `REMOTE_CI=NOT_RUN`, `FRESH_RECURSIVE_CLONE=NOT_RUN`.
- Record that the repository working tree is uncommitted and unpushed; publish
  `pnx_bsp` before the parent gitlink, then verify a recursive fresh clone.

The Vault was not modified.

## Project-state proposal

- Repository:
  `C:\Users\USER\Desktop\RM\rm校內賽\2026\firmware\pnx_f4_minimal`
- Branch: `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture`
- Firmware commit: `342efc481b7153acc2815ed511139a6c8847ff66`
- Core Debug hardware status: `VERIFIED` for the shortened attended smoke
  scope.
- Long-duration Core status: `UNVERIFIED`; the 30-minute soak was not run.
- USB CDC status: `VERIFIED` for the authorized shortened F407 ZLP boundary
  and recovery scope.
- CAN, motor-control, servo PWM, IMU, UART/DBUS, and concurrent-runtime
  hardware status: `UNVERIFIED`.

## Verified experiment proposal

- STM32F407 was programmed and Flash verification passed.
- Observed startup chain:
  `Reset_Handler -> main -> tx_application_define -> app_start`.
- ThreadX reached and remained in its scheduler wait path during samples.
- DWT was enabled and increased across steady-state samples.
- Reset recovery returned to ThreadX with DWT enabled.
- PH11 green-indicator GPIO transitioned, and the user observed the green LED
  blinking.
- The connected M2006 and A2 servo did not move.
- Evidence and limitations are recorded in `HANDOFF.md`.

## Open questions

- Does the Core image remain stable for the full planned 30-minute soak?
- Does the separately authorized USB identity enumerate and recover correctly?
- Do CAN, motor, servo, IMU, and UART vertical slices work on hardware?

## Reusable workflow note

For this workstation and probe, use Horco CMSIS-DAP v2 with OpenOCD
`interface/cmsis-dap.cfg`, not `interface/stlink.cfg`. GNU GDB 13.3 has a
non-ASCII Windows path issue for this repository; an ASCII-path copy of the
ELF may be used only after verifying that its SHA-256 matches the source
artifact.

## USB CDC follow-up proposal

- The separately authorized RM26_F4 identity enumerated on COM17 as
  `VID_0483&PID_5710`, product `Pikachu`, serial `LXYCAT`.
- USB CDC echo passed at 1, 16, and 63 bytes.
- The exact 64-byte echo failed with zero bytes returned before timeout.
- CPU fault registers remained clear and ThreadX was still scheduled after the
  failure.
- Read-only comparison found that the F407 USBX 6.1.10 callback bulk-IN path
  lacks the automatic ZLP support enabled in the `pnx_template` USBX 6.4.0
  configuration. This is the leading explanation, not yet a verified fix.
- USB CDC hardware status is `PARTIAL PASS / BLOCKED`; later binary, packet
  sequence, reconnect, reset/re-enumeration, and sustained-runtime checks are
  `NOT RUN`.
- The repository has an authorized uncommitted `CMakeLists.txt` change
  removing the old `0x0483` rejection. No firmware fix, commit, push, tag,
  IOC regeneration, or submodule change was made.

The preceding paragraph is retained as the pre-fix experiment. It was
superseded by the separately authorized `P0-F407-USB-ZLP-BOUNDARY-FIX`:

- Root cause was confirmed as missing termination for an exact 64-byte CDC IN
  packet in the F407 USBX 6.1.10 callback path.
- A board-local two-phase completion sends one ZLP after a successful exact
  full-packet transfer; common BSP and vendor/generated USBX remain unchanged.
- The ZLP policy was developed with RED/GREEN host regressions, including the
  partial-completion error path.
- Final software evidence: 12/12 host tests and 4/4 embedded builds PASS,
  compiler/linker warnings zero.
- Final programmed artifact SHA-256:
  `67E0989FB74EE5B0AC3B6C37550E52072892BE57198AE60BC0DF92D82F64B3EC`.
- Final artifact passed COM17 enumeration, 64-byte binary echo, 20/20 mixed
  1/16/63/64-byte packets, software reset/re-enumeration, and post-reset
  64-byte echo.
- The immediately preceding artifact also passed 100/100 mixed packets,
  physical USB cold reconnect, and a 15.005-second 15,909-packet continuous
  full-packet echo.
- The Horco CMSIS-DAP physical SRST command failed once. The target remained
  reachable, and using the configured Cortex-M `SYSRESETREQ` path with
  `reset_config none` allowed verified programming and reset.
- No IOC, generated/vendor USBX, common USB API, preset, submodule, commit,
  push, tag, or remote change was made.

## 2026-07-28 CAN1/M2006 proposal delta

- Record the clean F407 CAN1 vertical slice as hardware PASS:
  F407 board bxCAN backend -> existing `pnx_bsp/can` -> existing M2006/device
  handler -> dedicated application.
- Record final CAN artifact SHA-256
  `02C02F6A2B106B51F96E6A871DEFCC7DBAFE80747B6E44BC2C7AEB386BD3591D`.
- Record final telemetry: CAN RX/TX `9310/4583`, last ID `0x203`,
  error/drop/fault epoch `0/0/0`, pulse cycles `125`, final current `0`,
  complete/faulted `1/0`.
- Record the operator-observed very small, brief movement on the immediately
  preceding artifact using the same `+500`/250 ms sequence.
- Record software evidence: 18/18 host tests, backend source acceptance, and
  Core/USB/CAN Debug builds PASS with zero build warnings.
- Record that Core and USB product graphs exclude the CAN/M2006 closure.
- Record H7 leakage removal:
  `bsp::can::bus::fdcan1` -> `bsp::can::bus::none`.
- Record the provenance boundary: `pnx_devices` remains at detached HEAD
  `8a6783e63d77a15940aea8245bbe2eb13a2f2b11`; the one-line leakage correction
  is uncommitted inside the submodule, and the parent pointer was not changed.
- Record safe restoration to Core SHA-256
  `0B34622FE890F2BDF665F26D1CEF5120D139A6D365F66CAEF6A11993C2F529F2`.
- A2 PWM was not initialized or exercised.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-29 release-hardening proposal delta

- Record the corrected release state: attended DBUS live-frame validation is
  PASS, superseding DBUS software-only language in current release guidance.
- Record the ThreadX lifecycle rule: the F407 composition root runs in
  `tx_application_define()` before a schedulable application thread exists;
  waiting ThreadX APIs belong in thread entries.
- Record the USART diagnostic semantic fix: a circular-DMA restart returning
  `busy` increments `busy_count` rather than falsely reporting an error. A
  host regression test was observed RED before the change and PASS after it.
- Record the minimal CI gate proposal: recursive submodule checkout, host
  CTest, F407 Core build, and F407 DBUS build. It remains unexecuted remotely
  until the corresponding parent and submodule commits are pushed.
- Fresh local evidence after these changes: seven normal embedded builds,
  isolated CAN build, and 25/25 host tests PASS. No Vault content was
  modified.

## 2026-07-29 DBUS live-frame proposal delta

- Supersede the former `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN` boundary: attended F407
  validation is now PASS. USART3 PC11 DMA received 18-byte frames, the DR16
  parser published live data, and observed stick movement changed decoded
  axes.
- Record the two narrow source corrections needed by the live test: DR16
  ThreadX stack 768 -> 1536 bytes in `pnx_modules`, and DBUS demo subscription
  moved from `tx_application_define()` context into its monitor thread.
- Record software evidence for the corrected tree: DBUS embedded build PASS
  and 25/25 host tests PASS.
- Record safe restoration to Core artifact SHA-256
  `78F5C5C7B8A9E920370EAE43973F913988F1B6838EE81594C945FB78497A5463`, with
  OpenOCD program/verify PASS.
- No Vault content was modified. These changes remain uncommitted and were
  not pushed by this validation task.

## 2026-07-29 team-internal documentation and local revalidation proposal

- Record that the team-internal RC README now defines the backend, closure,
  and fail-closed terms and documents the repository tree plus CMake source
  composition flow.
- Record the fresh local software evidence on parent
  `7f0129ad6a789e4cb466a51697d0bad2a10854d1` plus document-only changes:
  seven normal embedded presets and isolated CAN/M2006 built successfully;
  native host tests passed 25/25.
- Record that the Core compile graph excludes all optional backend/closure
  sources and the shared-layer leakage scan remained clean.
- Retain the existing evidence boundary: no hardware was operated in this
  pass; `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN`, long soak, concurrent runtime, and
  destructive Flash validation remain unverified.
- `testing.md` is a transient checklist outside this repository; `HANDOFF.md`
  remains the detailed evidence record.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-29 CI release-gate proposal

- Record parent commit `648da10df13acd93b16053eb2d2921539b8fe7a3` as the
  minimal GitHub Actions authentication correction for private recursive
  submodule checkout; it injects only a repository-managed read-only secret
  into `actions/checkout@v7`.
- Record GitHub Actions run `30448274030` as remote evidence that recursive
  submodule checkout, host CTest, F407 Core build, and F407 DBUS build all
  succeeded from the pushed branch.
- Do not record the CI secret value. The remaining non-code release decisions
  are licensing and authorized production USB identity.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-29 final remote-gate revalidation proposal

- Record a second independent `--recurse-submodules` checkout of remote
  parent `957ce253a44d229b1aced496e8381956ace57bf0`.
- Record that it retrieved the four published F407 submodule commits, built
  all seven named F407 presets plus the isolated attended CAN image, and
  passed 25/25 host tests using root CMake with `PNX_HOST_TESTS=ON`.
- No hardware was operated. The DBUS live-frame and destructive Flash hardware
  limitations remain unchanged.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-29 release-candidate cleanup proposal delta

- Record the F407 release-hygiene cleanup: unused H7-template SPI2/SPI6 and
  TIM3/TIM12 generated configuration was removed; default Core no longer
  links the unselected Flash closure; and normal presets explicitly reset all
  optional application selectors.
- Record documentation authority: root README for image/build/release use;
  board README for IOC/manual-resource ownership; AGENTS for architecture
  constraints.
- Record fresh software evidence: 7/7 normal embedded presets, one isolated
  CAN attended image, and 25/25 host tests PASS; normal Core Ninja graph has
  no optional closure source.
- Preserve the evidence boundary: no hardware was operated in this cleanup;
  `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN`; Flash hardware is unverified; public-release
  licensing and remote fresh-clone verification remain open.
- Record the release-provenance repair: `.gitmodules` now names the tested
  `shiuhou` HTTPS remotes for `pnx_devices`, `pnx_libs`, and `pnx_modules`;
  the previous HKUSTGZ SSH URLs were not cloneable by the release environment.

The Vault was not modified.

## 2026-07-28 shared-peripheral completion proposal delta

- Record the F407 portable boundary cleanup as complete for SPI, PWM, Flash,
  memory placement, BMI088, USART3/DBUS software, and the motor default bus.
- Record formal local submodule commits:
  `pnx_bsp@899c0b491ec81e48ba8ed66ae90d451fb2bddc1b`,
  `pnx_devices@e90601d8676922db954c90a06de97ef82d87bf01`,
  `pnx_libs@205217a42ac4e1e556e63f594eb7671f47e0e2b9`, and
  `pnx_modules@deaae6720a6051c0276b1ffbeb3fc0fc875456dd`.
- Record final software evidence: seven normal embedded presets PASS, the
  explicit attended CAN validation build PASS, 25/25 host tests PASS, and
  zero observed build warnings.
- Record final BMI088 hardware artifact SHA-256
  `F7E32A275CDE72D309700A97285DDAB1557A777BE3E524A35F0AFA4FF2535C02`.
  It returned IDs `0x1E/0x0F`, incrementing samples, changing six-axis raw
  data, and complete/faulted `1/0`.
- Record that the automatic M2006 pulse image was removed from normal presets
  and retained only behind the explicit attended-validation option.
- Record `DBUS_LIVE_FRAME=NOT_RUN` by operator direction. USART contract,
  DR16 parser, remote module, and F407 DBUS image build are verified software
  evidence only.

## 2026-07-28 PWM/A2 proposal delta

- Record the F407 servo vertical slice as hardware PASS:
  board-neutral PWM contract -> F407 TIM1/PE11 backend -> C-board C2 signal
  mapping -> dedicated bounded servo application.
- Record the exact sequence
  `1500 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 1550 -> 1500 us`, followed by center and output
  disable.
- Record operator-observed servo movement and final telemetry:
  heartbeat/steps `5/5`, pulse `0`, complete/faulted `1/0`, output enabled
  `0`.
- Record software evidence: 20/20 host tests and Core/USB/CAN/PWM Debug builds
  PASS with zero observed build warnings.
- Record PWM artifact SHA-256
  `C3BF015E8354CD31369A031419CB676CFA33D92AAF425E32B61FE893D0E5EC5A`.
- Record that Core, USB, and CAN graphs exclude the PWM backend.
- Record safe restoration to Core SHA-256
  `6D0CEFDCD1CE31DD4E0074813B4596912B2AFE6B4D6E278B0AE97EC83352964C`.
- Record the provenance boundary: `pnx_bsp` remains at detached HEAD
  `f61e8ac8ac4b75d93b021ec32a8ecf56fc36a73b`; its PWM change is uncommitted.
- Record the deferred integration boundary: dormant BMI088 code still uses
  the former timer-specific channel names and must migrate during its own
  vertical slice.

## 2026-07-29 final release-candidate reproducibility proposal

- Supersede earlier no-push statements: four submodule branches and parent
  `refactor/f407-minimal-architecture` are now pushed.
- The parent records cloneable `shiuhou` HTTPS URLs for all submodules.
- A clean recursive checkout of parent
  `4a3a101a3d201b3d61cad71df730ed059559b7e0` reached all exact gitlinks,
  built seven normal F407 images plus isolated CAN, and passed 25/25 host
  tests.
- Retain the hardware boundary: this release cleanup did not operate hardware;
  DBUS live frames and destructive Flash hardware remain unverified.
